This is the code repo for my 2025 course: *Applied Complex Analysis*. The easiest way to play with and modify the code is to open and run within a browser, by clicking the *MyBinder* button above. If you wish, you can run the notebooks locally by [installing the Julia langauge](https://julialang.org/downloads/), and suitable notebook software (for example, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).
